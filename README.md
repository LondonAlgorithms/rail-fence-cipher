# Algorithm Challenge Boilerplate

```
git clone https://github.com/LondonAlgorithms/boilerplate.git
cd boilerplate
```

Here's some tips for creating a great algorithm challenge:

- Write a readme
- Add specs
- Add function definitions
- Add helpers
- Update `src/algo.js` filename with name of algo
- Update `spec/spec.js` `<title>` with name of algo


## Readme

- Introduction: Write a clear description of the algorithm
- Resources: Include links to any slides, blog posts or articles if you are relying on them to help people to quickly grasp the concepts involved
- The challenge: Describe the challenge step by step (enough so someone without prior explanation can get started)
- Helpers: Document the helpers you are providing and, if helpful, explain the role they play in the algorithm
- Credits


## Specs

- Start with some easy functions (give people a foot in the door)
- Specs should correspond the functions the student is writing

## Function definitions

- Create shell functions
- Document functions using JSDoc
- Try to keep functions in an order that corresponds to the specs

## Helpers

- Abstract away all the icky complex code into helpers
- Document in the readme
